        "desp": "Quantum computing is an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory (which explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and subatomic levels). Computers used today can only encode information in bits that take the value of 1 or 0—restricting their ability. Quantum computing, on the other hand, uses quantum bits or qubits. It harnesses the unique ability of subatomic particles that allows them to exist in more than one state (i.e., a 1 and a 0 at the same time)."

It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as Wigner's friend, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative. Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy."

Data scientists must be skilled in everything from data engineering, math, statistics, advanced computing and visualizations to be able to effectively sift through muddled masses of information and communicate only the most vital bits that will help drive innovation and efficiency. Data scientists also rely heavily on artificial intelligence, especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, to create models and make predictions using algorithms and other techniques.

It is the science that enables machines and computer systems to process, analyze and interpret data with the aim of providing solutions for real-life challenges. Computer systems can learn and take actions on their own due to the level of sufficient data provided through Machine Learning. The algorithm is set up in such a way that machines can predict outcomes based on past occurrences. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques help in training a model with data presented which will then predict and adjust to future outcomes."

Fuzzy Logic helps to offer a certain level of reasoning flexibility when faced with uncertainties. This might sound a bit complex but it is simply a case of using standard logic to determine if a concept exhibits a degree of truth. For instance, standard logic is 1.0 if a concept is TRUE and 0.0 if a concept is FALSE. However, there are cases where a concept can either be partially true or partially false. "
